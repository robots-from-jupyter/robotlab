  description: |
    SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework that utilizes
    the Selenium tool internally. The project is hosted on GitHub and downloads
    can be found from PyPI.

    SeleniumLibrary works with Selenium 2.53.6 or newer, including Selenium 3.
    It supports Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.3 or newer. In addition to the
    normal Python interpreter, it works also with PyPy and Jython.
    Unfortunately Selenium is not currently supported by IronPython and thus
    this library does not work with IronPython either.
